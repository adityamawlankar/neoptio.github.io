                      <p class="mb-30">To understanding our target audience, we started by drafting personas which helps define a new design in a market by creating a clear, detailed understanding of target users. Personas helped us humanize the audience, guiding design decisions to cater to specific needs and preferences. They helped align team members on user goals, prioritize features, and enhance user experience by addressing pain points.
                        This approach improved marketing strategies, predicting user behavior, and saved time by avoiding broad, ineffective solutions. By focusing on well-defined personas, we ensured the final product is relevant, valuable, and tailored to the intended market, leading to greater user satisfaction and success.</p>

                          <li>2. Starting Assessment</li>
                          <p>Create clear instructions outlining the initial assessment's purpose.

                      <!-- <h5>Interaction Patterns</h5>
                      <p class="mb-30">One common thread across the application is the use of modules that can be scrolled horizontally. I found that this interaction pattern allowed users to see more details in each module, more so than a standard list format with vertical scrolling. This was particularly useful in creating the nanny cards. I took inspiration from dating apps like Tinder where users are taken through a selection journey one individual at a time. I found that a horizontal scroll interaction helped parents to connect with nanny profiles more by narrowing the user’s attention to roughly 3-5 nannies in a single glance. 
                        Horizontal scroll was also useful in other features of the app, such as learn. This use of two dimensions helps users by showing a variety of options without making them visit separate category pages (selections from discussions and articles can be placed in one overview page, for example)</p>
                      <a class="popup-img">
                        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42596601/115327922-a6031500-a144-11eb-935c-916b6fcc81c1.png" class="res" alt="reviews2" >
                      </a> -->

                      <h5>4. Style Guide</h5>
                      <p class="mb-30">The modules in our application was inspired by Google’s Material Design, which uses more grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows. As for the colour scheme, we focused on creating a bright and vibrant palette with an iconic purple accent to convey a cheerful and light-hearted feel.

                        <p class="mb-30">
                          Overall, we wanted Neoptio to follow conventional mobile-application style guidelines so that it was easy for new users to learn the various interactions of the application, modelling the modularity of the application with the likes of Facebook, Instagram, some of the most commonly used applications amongst our target demographic.
                        </p>

                      

                    <h5>5. Prototyping</h5>
                    <p class="mb-30">Prototyping helped us define a new design in the market by providing a tangible, interactive representation of the product. It allowed us to test and validate concepts early, identify usability issues, and gather user feedback before full-scale development. 

                      This iterative process helped refine functionality, aesthetics, and overall user experience, ensuring the design meet market needs and expectations. It also facilitated better communication among stakeholders, aligned vision and reduced misunderstanding. By detecting and addressing potential problems early, prototyping helped us save time and resources, ultimately leading to a more polished, user-centered final product that will be well-suited for the market.</p>
